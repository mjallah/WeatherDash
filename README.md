# WeatherDash
Overview
Creating a 5 day weather forecast using css, javascript and an API call.

First I started by creating and styling my main index using bootstrap and css.

Once I completed those, I created a weatherapp.js and index.js. The weather app is where i have my API key and my base URL. my index.js is where I added my event listners to be able to show the changes on my index.html.

Had troubles having my index.html update from my index.js as when I copy my classes to index.js I am getting an error.

Decided to scratch previous project and make a very basic weather dashboard using  what we learned from class rather than a complex one. Much easier!

Users can put a city into the search for city bar and this app will autopopulte a 5 day forecast of the city as well as current temp and uv index.

Previously searched cities will be posted under clear history bar.
